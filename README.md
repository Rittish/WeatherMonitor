# WeatherMonitor
🌤️ Weather Monitoring System using ESP8266 + ThingSpeak + Frontend
A smart IoT-based Weather Monitoring System using ESP8266 that collects temperature and humidity data and sends it to ThingSpeak. The live data is visualized through a frontend dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis.

🔧 Technologies Used
📡 ESP8266 (NodeMCU) – Collects weather data via sensors
🌡️ DHT11/DHT22 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity
☁️ ThingSpeak – Cloud platform for real-time IoT data
💻 Frontend Dashboard – Displays live weather data
🌐 HTML/CSS/JS – Frontend development

⚙️ Features
🌦️ Real-time temperature & humidity tracking
☁️ Auto-sync with ThingSpeak for cloud monitoring
📊 Clean and responsive frontend dashboard
🔄 Continuous updates with no manual refresh
📥 Future-ready for data export and analytics

🚀 How It Works
1. ESP8266 reads sensor data (Temp & Humidity).
2. Data is sent to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi.
3. Dashboard fetches & displays it live.
